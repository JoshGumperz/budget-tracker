Budget Tracker

For this assignment we were tasked with creating an expense/budget tracker that allows you to add and withdraw money both online and offline. 

### Prerequisites

I've included a link to the heroku deployed site below, but it's important to note that I was unable to get the deployed site to work offline. If you'd like to use the offline capabilities, you'll need to run the local version. And for that you'll need to have Node installed. 

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look. 

Upon initially loading in to the site you will see a home page that looks like this

From here you can input how much money you'd like to add or subtract to/from your total budget.

You will then see a graph populate with your budget data

If you need some additional help getting the local version set up here are some instructions for that:

First, open up a terminal or bash in the root directory and run the command "npm i".

Next run the command "npm run start" and the script will do the rest for you.

Once the server starts up, you can copy the link and paste it in a browser window to start using the site.
